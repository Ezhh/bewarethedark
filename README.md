Description
-----------

This is a mod for MineTest. It's only function is to make
darkness and light a valid mechanic for the default minetest_game.
In other voxel games, darkness is dangerous because it spawns
monsters. In MineTest, darkness just makes it more likely for you
to walk into a tree.

This mod changes that in a very direct fashion: you are damaged
by darkness, the darker the damager. So craft those torches!

Current behavior
----------------

If you stand in a node with light level 7 or less, you slowly
lose "sanity", represented by a hud bar with eyes. The darker it is,
the more sanity you lose per second. When you run out of sanity,
you get damaged instead!

Stand in bright light to replenish sanity. Sunlight is best, but
directly on top of a torch should work, too.

Future plans
------------

None at the moment.
